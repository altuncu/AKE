The paper proposes a *simple* but *effective* post-processing-based universal approach to improving the performance of *any* AKE methods, via an enhanced level of semantic-awareness supported by PoS tagging. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, we considered word types retrieved from a PoS tagging step and two representative sources of semantic information â€” specialised terms defined in one or more context-dependent thesauri, and named entities in Wikipedia. The above three steps can be simply added to the end of *any* AKE methods as part of a post-processor, which simply re-evaluates all candidate keywords following some *context-specific* and *semantic-aware* criteria.  For five state-of-the-art (SOTA) AKE methods, our experimental results with 17 selected datasets showed that the proposed approach improved their performances both *consistently* (up to 100% in terms of improved cases) and *significantly* (between 10.2% and 53.8%, with an average of 25.8%, in terms of F1-score and across all five methods), especially when all the three enhancement steps are used.
